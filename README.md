# Coffee_Shop_Sales_Analysis
This project analyzes transactional data from a coffee shop chain with ~150,000 records. The dataset includes details about orders, products, pricing, and store locations. It’s designed to help practice SQL queries, data analysis, and business insights across different difficulty levels.

# Dataset Columns

transaction_id – Unique identifier for each order

transaction_date – Date of purchase

transaction_time – Time of purchase

transaction_qty – Quantity of items purchased

store_id – Unique identifier for each coffee shop branch

store_location – Location of the store

product_id – Unique identifier for each menu item

unit_price – Price per unit of the item

product_category – Category (e.g., Coffee, Tea, Bakery, Snacks)

product_type – Sub-category (e.g., Latte, Espresso, Muffin)

product_detail – Detailed description of the item

# The analysis questions:
--Easy

# Purpose

The goal of this project is to use coffee shop sales data to improve data analysis skills. By working through different levels of questions, I can apply SQL to uncover sales trends, customer preferences, and store performance. The idea is to treat the dataset like a real business case , finding insights that a coffee shop manager or owner might actually care about , while also building a project that showcases practical data analytics and business intelligence skills.
